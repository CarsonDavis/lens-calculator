# Research Camera Format Equivalence Equations

## Message 1
> i want you to carefully research all the equations used for converting between different camera formats. what focal length on one body is equivalent to the focal length on another. what aperature gives what depth of field on one body vs another. mathematical calculation of bokeh. go deep and get into the specifics. we want to think about how conversions work on formats that don't match their ratios -- we will need to choose whether we want to look at total area of the frame as a conversion, or match the width, or match the height. we should be able to calculate depth of field from any arbitrary sensor/film size, aperture, and focal length. if i give a lens: aps-c, 35mm, f/2.8, we should be able to calculate an equivalent lens and focal length on 6x7. research deeply, do many searches, double check your assumptions, and build out a full system of categorized equations

# Scrape Wikipedia Pages with Equations
