# Lens Equations Research

Reference materials for the optical formulas used in this project.

## Reading Order

### 1. Start Here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **report.md** | Consolidated reference — all formulas for equivalence, DOF, CoC, and blur in one place |

### 2. Primary Sources

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **circle_of_confusion.md** | Wikipedia article — CoC definitions, blur circle formulas, format-specific values |
| **depth_of_field.md** | Wikipedia article — DOF formulas, hyperfocal distance, near/far limits |

These are the gold standard. Scraped directly from Wikipedia to capture equations and tables.

### 3. Deep Dive

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **background.md** | Extended research — covers additional topics beyond the Wikipedia articles |

## Reference Only

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **chat_messages.md** | Historical — conversation log from initial research session |
| **scrape_wikipedia.py** | Tooling — script used to fetch Wikipedia content with equations intact |

## How to Use

When answering a technical question:

1. **Check report.md first** — has the consolidated formulas
2. **Verify against Wikipedia sources** — circle_of_confusion.md and depth_of_field.md
3. **Go deeper if needed** — background.md for extended coverage
