# Research Modern React Web Development

## Message 1
> let's do some deep research on modern html5 web development with react. i want to finish with a final guide with clear guidelines on html and css guidelines, project setup for react, linting and code quality add ons, environment management, project structure, testing, etc etc.

## Message 2
> ok, i have a team that i'm going to be working with that has a couple reference repos. we can probably clone them in a subfolder and theck them out
> https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-backend
> https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-ui
> my goal is to see wat standards they are using.

## Message 3
> ok, talk to me about the differences

## Message 4
> write this up in a report of sota vs veda in our react web guide. at the beginning of the report, explain the repos used to do the comparison

## Message 5
> ok, i want to make an example project to better learn how veda does things (learn their technology stack). I DON"T want to mindlessly use everything, especially not the css stuff which i will use sota for. what do you think my stack should be to strike a balance between knowing sota and learning the veda way

## Message 6
> great. write up a final report that talks about the final technology stack. no need to reference veda or sota in the report. just clear technologies to use for what functionalities

## Message 7
> update my @readme.md so that is has the info

## Message 8
> no, the one in react

## Message 9
> no, no, no. the readme just should explain why i did this research and what the files are. nothing else
