## Subject Distance and Equivalent Lenses

When comparing two lenses, you're not comparing the same distance from the subject — you're comparing taking the same photo with two different lenses.

If you have a full frame camera with a 50mm f/1.4 and you want to know what aperture on an 85mm would give the same blur disc, the assumption is: you're standing further away from the subject with your 85mm lens so that the same height/width/diagonal/area of the subject is visible in the frame.

Same framing, different distance.

## Focal Length Equivalence

A 50mm lens is always a 50mm lens. The glass doesn't change when you put it on a different camera.

What changes is how much of the image circle your sensor captures. A smaller sensor crops into the center, so you see a narrower field of view — as if you'd used a longer lens on a larger sensor.

That's all "equivalent focal length" means: the focal length on format B that gives you the same field of view as your lens on format A.

A 50mm on APS-C shows the same framing as a 75mm on full frame. The 50mm didn't become a 75mm — you're just seeing a cropped portion of what the lens projects.

## Light Gathering vs Bokeh

The f-number (like f/1.4 or f/2.8) describes two different things, and this causes endless confusion.

**For exposure:** f/1.4 is f/1.4 on any format. A 25mm f/1.4 on Micro Four Thirds and an 85mm f/1.4 on medium format both need the same shutter speed and ISO for a correct exposure. The f-number is a ratio, and ratios scale.

**For background blur:** what matters is the physical size of the aperture opening — the entrance pupil. A 50mm f/1.4 lens has a 35.7mm entrance pupil (50 ÷ 1.4). A 25mm f/1.4 has only a 17.9mm entrance pupil.

Bigger entrance pupil = more blur. That's why "equivalent aperture" exists: it tells you what f-number on another format gives you the same entrance pupil, and therefore the same background blur.

The 25mm f/1.4 on Micro Four Thirds gives equivalent blur to a 50mm f/2.8 on full frame — same entrance pupil, same blur, but also same depth of field. Your exposure settings would differ (f/1.4 vs f/2.8), but the images would look the same.

## DOF vs Blur Disc

These measure different things.

**Depth of field** is the range of distances that appear sharp. It answers: "how much of my scene is in focus?" A shallow DOF means a thin slice is sharp; a deep DOF means more of the scene is sharp.

**Blur disc** is how blurry an out-of-focus point becomes — a point of light renders as a little circle. It answers: "how blurry does the background look?" A larger blur disc means creamier, more dissolved backgrounds.

You can have shallow DOF with modest blur (close subject, moderate aperture) or deep DOF with strong blur (distant subject, wide aperture, long lens). They're related, but not the same thing.

### Why this matters for equivalence

When you calculate the standard equivalent focal length and aperture, both DOF and blur disc match automatically. A 50mm f/1.4 on full frame and a 33mm f/0.9 on APS-C produce the same image — same framing, same sharpness zone, same background blur.

But what if you override the focal length? Say you're comparing a 50mm f/1.4 on full frame to a 35mm on APS-C — not the "equivalent" 33mm, but the lens you actually own.

Now you have to choose what "equivalent" means:

- **Match blur disc:** "I want the backgrounds to look equally blurry." Choose this when the aesthetic of the out-of-focus areas matters most — typically portraits.

- **Match DOF:** "I want the same range of distances to be sharp." Choose this when you care about what's in focus vs out of focus — typically product shots or landscapes.

These require different apertures because DOF is defined by the circle of confusion (which scales with sensor diagonal), while blur disc is perceived relative to frame width. At the standard equivalent focal length, these two constraints happen to intersect. At any other focal length, they don't.
