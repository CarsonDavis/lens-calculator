## Subject Distance and Equivalent Lenses

When comparing two lenses, you're not comparing the same distance from the subject — you're comparing taking the same photo with two different lenses.

If you have a full frame camera with a 50mm f/1.4 and you want to know what aperture on an 85mm would give the same blur disc, the assumption is: you're standing further away from the subject with your 85mm lens so that the same height/width/diagonal/area of the subject is visible in the frame.

Same framing, different distance.
