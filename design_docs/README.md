# Design Documentation

Guide to the design docs for developers working on this project.

## Reading Order

### 1. Start Here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **requirements.md** | What the app does — inputs, outputs, UI layout, user interactions |
| **architecture.md** | How it's built — project structure, tech stack, key decisions |

### 2. Implementation Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **calculations.md** | All formulas organized by situation — the math behind equivalence, DOF, blur |
| **types.md** | TypeScript data model — shapes for formats, state, and results |
| **formats.md** | Preset format data — sensor dimensions for common cameras |
| **design-system.md** | Visual language — colors, typography, spacing, component styles (dark mode only) |

### 3. Content

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **info-content.md** | Plain-language explanations for the UI's educational panels |

## Reference Only

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **architecture-questionnaire.md** | Historical — questions and answers that led to initial architecture decisions |
| **architecture-questionnaire-2.md** | Historical — follow-up decisions on URL format, validation, responsive layout, etc. |
| **chat_messages.md** | Historical — conversation log capturing design decisions |

These capture *why* decisions were made but aren't needed for implementation.
