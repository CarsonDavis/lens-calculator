# CI/CD Setup Discussion

## Message 1

> ok i want you to look at @README.md and @design_docs/README.md and let's think through how we can deploy this to the web. i already have a website codebycarson.com where i put things, like app.codebycarson.com. it is on aws and you can go see how it works by using my personal profile in ~.aws. i would like to use ci/cd that runs our tests on pr and deploys the master branch, etc

## Message 2

> no need to tie ourselves to those practices if they are not sota

## Message 3

> sure, let's use the cloudflare pages. i want the app to be lens-calc.codebycarson.com. well wait, i would have to log onto cloudflare to finish the setup? which other options have preview deploys on every pr?

## Message 4

> aws is really easy because we can do everything cli. what is the difference between aws and amplify and the cloudflare pages?

## Message 5

> what is the ongoing management for amplify?

## Message 6

> let's document this decision and our strategy in our design_docs in a ci/cd.md

## Message 7

> go ahead and make and configure everything

## Message 8
